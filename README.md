# MSeasIAR

Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) most often includes self-injecting medicine into the subcutis, the tissue layer between the skin and the muscle. The injections can make a patient’s skin sore, red, itchy, and even cause pain, thus many patients suffer from injection anxiety. The aim of our work is to determine whether an application based on augmented reality (AR) technology can help reduce patients’ injection anxiety and perceived pain during the administration of their medication. An AR application, MSeasIAR, that allows MS patients to visualise injection sites with the help of an overlaid AR grid which also serves to keep track of their previous injections, was developed. In addition, they can set push notification reminders to help them with brain fog which can be one of the symptoms of MS medicines.
